''' Suppose you have a list of tuples and a set. How would you find all tuples where the first element exists in the set?
Example:
tuples_list = [ (1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c"), (1, "d") ]  
target_set = {1, 3}  
 '''

tuples_list = [ (1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c"), (1, "d") ]  
target_set = {1, 3}

for t in tuples_list:
    if t[0] in target_set:
        print(t)
